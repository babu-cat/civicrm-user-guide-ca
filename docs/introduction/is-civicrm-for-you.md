# Is CiviCRM for You?

This chapter will help you to decide whether CiviCRM is the right tool
for your organisation.

CiviCRM is powerful software and has the potential to help your
organisation reach its goals - but it won't be the right choice for
every organisation. Here are some ways that you can find out whether
CiviCRM is right for your organisation:

-   identify your organisation's needs
-   check out [the CiviCRM Statistics page](https://stats.civicrm.org/?tab=sites)
-   read [case studies about how similar organizations use CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org/case-studies/)
-   play with [one of many free CiviCRM demonstration sites](https://civicrm.org/demo)
-   talk to others who use CiviCRM
-   talk to [a CiviCRM consultant](https://civicrm.org/partners-contributors)
-   Try [CiviCRM Spark](https://civicrm.org/spark) and easily get your own installation of CiviCRM up-and-running in minutes on SAS hosting, starting from $9.50 a month. You can cancel at any time. CiviCRM Spark is ideal for testing and trialing CiviCRM, or for on-going use by smaller organizations and activities with up to 2,000 contacts.
-   download and install [a test CiviCRM database](https://civicrm.org/download) for free

## Talking to others who use CiviCRM

If you know of another organisation that uses CiviCRM, talk to them
about their experience. Obviously the more similar they are to your
organisation, the better. If you don't know anyone that is using
CiviCRM, contact a [CiviCRM Expert](https://civicrm.org/partners-contributors), look at [case studies on CiviCRM.org](https://civicrm.org/case-studies/), or try your local non-profit technology mailing list.

The [CiviCRM StackExchange](https://civicrm.stackexchange.com/)
is a very good place to both ask and get answers to questions.
Try to formulate your question separately before posting and submit it 
as concisely as possible - trying as much as possible to use the names 
and terms used within CiviCRM (as opposed to those used by your business
model). This can improve the service you receive from the forums 
considerably! 
Stack Exchange questions are answered by volunteers, so the easier it is for them to understand, the more quickly the answers will come.
If you wish to ask questions or contribute to the discussions you must 
register a Stack Exchange account first.

## Talking to CiviCRM Consultants

Another option to help you understand CiviCRM is to talk with a
professional. The CiviCRM website lists [contributors, partners and sponsors](https://civicrm.org/partners-contributors) that can walk you through CiviCRM, and
there are many others; you may find a local website company who has
experience with CiviCRM. Consider contacting a consultant for a meeting to
discuss how CiviCRM could help your organisation.
