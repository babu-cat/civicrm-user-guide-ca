# Free Software?

CiviCRM is **Free Software** - this means it is developed by a community
and licensed in a generous way so you can use it for free for whatever
you want.

Free Software (sometimes also referred to as [**Free and Open Source
Software**, **FLOSS**, **FOSS**, **Software Libre**, or **Open
Source**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) is software that anyone can download, share, and --
significantly -- change in any way they want. Practically speaking, you
might never want to change the software, or even have a staff person who
can read the **source code** (the instructions written by programmers).
But the ability to change the software protects you in many ways:

-   **CiviCRM** will not go away, unlike non-free software from some
    companies that gets abandoned if the company goes bankrupt or
    decides to discontinue a specific product.
-   The software can be used and customised free of charge.
-   Nobody can suddenly take away features or change the terms under
    which you are allowed to use the software and its features. 
-   If an organisation wants a feature that CiviCRM doesn't provide, the
    organisation can hire someone to create it. Of course, the
    organisation can also submit a feature request to the CiviCRM team
    as with any software product.
-   Similarly, anyone can fix a **bug** (error in the software) if they have
    the skills to do so. Because the source code is available,
    clients can also find bugs more easily.
-   Members of the community have much more input into how CiviCRM
    develops than is traditionally available via closed
    source/commercial software, because they can understand the product
    by reading the code and can make changes. Furthermore, many people
    can try different implementations of features and the community can
    decide by vote or consensus which one to make official. 

That may be enough for you, but for the sake of completeness we'll offer
some widely used definitions:

**"Free software** or **software libre** is software that can be used,
studied, and modified without restriction, and which can be copied and
redistributed in modified or unmodified form either without restriction,
or with minimal restrictions only to ensure that further recipients can
also do these things and that manufacturers of consumer-facing hardware
allow user modifications to their hardware. Free software is available
gratis (free of charge) in most cases."*
(from:
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software))*

**"Open source software (OSS)** is defined as computer software for
which the source code and certain other rights normally reserved for
copyright holders are provided under a software license that meets the
Open Source Definition or that is in the public domain. This permits
users to use, change, and improve the software, and to redistribute it
in modified or unmodified forms. It is very often developed in a public,
collaborative manner." 
*(from:
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software))*

Nearly any software that qualifies as free also qualifies as Open
Source, and vice versa. The main reason that two different terms exist
is that "free software" emphasizes the freedom aspect (that you aren't
under the control of the original programmers) whereas "open source
software" emphasizes the convenience and potential for innovation
provided by having the source code available.

When you install and use CiviCRM, you'll notice there is no annoying
click-through **software license** imposing a thousand things that you
can or cannot do with it. That's because free software doesn't limit
your right to do with the software whatever you want. Free and open
source software have licenses, but they're simpler than and quite
different from **proprietary** **software** ('closed software')
licenses. CiviCRM itself is available under **Affero General Public
License version 3.0**, one of the popular free software licenses used by
many other projects.

## Free Software and non-profits

Explaining all of the possible considerations on using FOSS in
non-profit and advocacy work might take a really long time, so let's
focus on the most important highlights:

-   One of the priorities of FOSS projects, including CiviCRM, is to
    involve the community of users in the process of designing and
    building the software. In the long run, this not only assures that
    the software is doing exactly what it should do to sustain the needs
    of its users, but it also allows indirect exchange of knowledge and
    experience between organisations. By using CiviCRM, you are
    basically taking advantage of other non-profit and advocacy
    practitioners' experience. 
-   Having access to the source code gives you and your organisation a
    certain level of independence. With proprietary software it is
    usually impossible to customise the tools to meet your specific
    needs. With FOSS, you can hire a developer or consultant and work
    with them on providing specific functionality needed in your work.
    Additionally, if you contribute your improvements to the project
    community other organisations will probably start using them. It
    means you can receive testing and further improvements of your
    functionality for free.
-   When a company which provided you with closed software goes out of
    business, the usual procedure for an organisation reliant on that
    software is to abandon the software and start investing in a new one
    (which is resource intensive and costly). It's less likely to happen
    with Free and Open Source Software - there is always a community of
    users and developers around it and there is no single "point of
    failure." With FOSS projects, if the main organisation behind a
    specific piece of software shuts down or changes their focus, the
    community takes over, a new organisation is formed and the software
    development and support continues.

Apart from the practical advantages listed above, there is also a more
philosophical approach to answering the question of importance of FOSS
for non-profits and advocacy organisations. Without getting too deep
into philosophical discussions, there is a great overlap between values
shared by non-profit organisations and those shared by Free and Open
Source Software communities. By working with the community of users,
providing your feedback, contributing your changes back into the
project, you are actually strengthening the non-profit sector.
