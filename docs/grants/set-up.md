# Set-up

Set up of CiviGrant is reasonably straightforward. The first thing to do
is to enable the CiviGrant module in **Administer > System Settings >
Enable Components**.

## Grant types

Grant types are set up on the **Administer > CiviGrant > Grant types**
screen. There isn't much to configure here, apart from a title and
description of the grant.

At the moment, you cannot add custom data to grant *types* but you can
add it to grants (see below).

## Grant statuses

The option list for **Grant status** can be found on the **Administer >
System Settings > Option Groups** screen. Select Options on the right
of the Grant status line to view existing options or create new statuses
to match your grant giving workflow.

## Custom data for grants

You can add custom data to grants:

1.  Go to **Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Custom Fields**.
2.  Click on **Add Set of Custom Fields**.
3.  Set **Used For** to **Grant**

Consider adding custom data fields to upload the original application
form; these could be converted to PDF before uploading to make them read
only and reasonably future compatible.

See the chapter on [custom data](../organising-your-data/creating-custom-fields.md) for more information about setting up custom
data.
