# Scheduled jobs

CiviCRM relies on a number of scheduled jobs that run automatically on a regular basis. These jobs keep data up-to-date and perform other important tasks. For example, there is a job which sends scheduled reminders, a job which checks for CiviCRM software updates, and many other jobs too. 

## How scheduled jobs are initiated {:#initiation}

An important characteristic of scheduled jobs is that they run *automatically*. However, CiviCRM (like most other web-based applications) actually can't _initiate_ actions itself &mdash; it can only _respond_ to actions that other systems initiate. For most of CiviCRM's functionality, it relies on _people_ to initiate those actions. For example, when a person submits a form, CiviCRM creates a new contact record. Because scheduled jobs must run automatically, CiviCRM relies on a piece of external software called "cron" to initiate them.

### Understanding cron {:#cron}
    
"Cron" is a piece of software, separate from CiviCRM, which is typically installed on server systems to initiate tasks automatically. Here are some important points to understand about cron, as you configure your CiviCRM scheduled jobs:

* Cron must be setup to initiate CiviCRM's scheduled jobs before those scheduled jobs will run automatically. That setup is outside the scope of this User Guide because it involves "system" level tasks that you can't do from within the CiviCRM user interface.

    !!! tip "Cron setup"
        To setup cron, refer to the [Cron setup](https://docs.civicrm.org/sysadmin/en/latest/setup/jobs/#cron) page in the System Administrator Guide.
        
* Cron can be configured in different ways.
        
    * You system administrator will typically configure cron to run on a regular interval with a frequency between 5 and 60 minutes. Each time cron "runs", cron tells CiviCRM to execute whatever scheduled jobs CiviCRM deems necessary at that time. This means that the granularity available to configure specific scheduled jobs is limited by the cron job frequency. For example, if cron only runs once every day, then it will not be possible for a scheduled job to run every hour. So it's best to have your system administrator configure cron to run frequently enough to meet your needs.
    
    * Alternatively, system administrators can configure _separate_ cron jobs to run specific CiviCRM scheduled jobs, although this type of setup is less common.

    * From within the CiviCRM user interface, there is no way to see how cron is configured.

## Configuring scheduled jobs {:#configuring}

To configure scheduled jobs, go to **Administer > System Settings > Scheduled Jobs**.

### Scheduled jobs vs API calls {:#jobs-vs-api}

CiviCRM has a subsystem called the "API" which allows developers and integrators to perform all sorts of useful tasks. (You can read the full [API docs](https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/latest/api/) in the Developer Guide.) CiviCRM *users* typically don't need to understand anything about the API, but when interacting with scheduled jobs, some understanding is helpful.

An "API call" is basically an instruction for CiviCRM to do something. For example, the `ContributionPage.create` API call will create a new contribution page &mdash; and the person constructing the API call can add *parameters* to it in order to specify characteristics of that newly created contribution page, like its title and financial type. Each API call has an "entity" (`ContributionPage` in the above example), and an "action" (`create` in the above example). 

A scheduled job is the combination of an API call and a schedule (e.g. "hourly"). When you add a new scheduled job, you can specify *any* API call. So, you could for example, use scheduled jobs to automatically create a new contribution page every day. Of course this example is not very useful. What makes scheduled jobs useful is the fact that the CiviCRM API provides many actions that site maintainers will commonly wish to perform on a regular schedule. For example, the API call `Job.send_reminder` will send scheduled reminders.

### Default scheduled jobs {:#default-jobs}

A fresh install of CiviCRM comes with over a dozen scheduled jobs already partially configured. These "default" scheduled jobs offer a starting point for you to configure your own scheduled jobs. If you like, you can rename them or delete them. Then later on, you can refer to the [specific jobs](#specific-jobs) section of this page for all the necessary details to re-create any of these default scheduled jobs (and other jobs too).

!!! caution "Parameters needed"
    Some of the default scheduled jobs require [parameters](#parameters) to be configured before they can run properly.

### Job frequency {:#frequency}

Some jobs need to be run very frequently, for example the email send task should typically be run once every 5 or 10 minutes. Others need to be run less frequency, for example the membership update script can easily be run just once a day.

When adding or editing a scheduled job you can select a "Run frequency" as follows:

* Yearly
* Quarterly
* Monthly
* Weekly
* Daily
* Hourly
* Every time cron job is run

!!! note
    As described in the [cron](#cron) section above, your system administrator will need to configure cron to run at a specified interval. Every 5 minutes is a common frequency, but from within the CiviCRM user interface it's impossible to determine cron's schedule. Scheduled jobs cannot run more frequently than cron. So if cron is set to run weekly, then choosing the "daily" setting for a scheduled job will mean that it only gets run weekly. 

### Job timing {:#timing}

Let's pretend you want to schedule a job to run monthly, but it's also important to you that the job be run on the 15th day of each month. Unfortunately the scheduled jobs system system does not allow you this level of control. When you set a job to run monthly, it will continue to run one month after the first time it is run.

If you need more control over your job timing, you can [create separate cron jobs to execute specific CiviCRM API calls](https://docs.civicrm.org/sysadmin/en/latest/setup/jobs/#specific-jobs-via-cron).

### Command parameters {:#parameters}

When editing a scheduled job, CiviCRM gives you a "command parameters" field where you can specify input parameters which affect the way the job runs. Each job has its own parameters, and some jobs don't accept any parameters. The parameters for each job are documented in detail within the [specific jobs](#specific-jobs) section below. 

!!! note "Example"
    
    Let's look at an example of how you use these parameters to fill out the "command parameters" field...
    
    The [Job.mail_report](#job_mail_report) job documents the following parameters:
    
    > * `instanceId` (required): ID of report instance to send
    > * `format` (optional)
    >     * `pdf` (default)
    >     * `csv`  to output the report as a CSV file instead of default PDF format
    >     * `print` output the report as printer-friendly HTML
    > * `sendmail` (optional):
    >     * `1` send email
    >     * `0` _don't_ email the report. Use this in combination with `print` or `csv` format to write report to stdout so you can save it to a disk file.
    
    So for example, you might choose to fill out the "command parameters" field as follows:
    
    ```text
    instanceId=7
    format=csv
    ```

As you can see in the example above, you'll need to use the following process to fill out the "command parameters" field:

* Use one parameter per line
* Use an equals sign `=` between the parameter and its value
* Don't use any spaces
* Don't use any quotes

### Manually executing a scheduled job {:#manual-execution}

You can also run scheduled jobs on a one-off basis by clicking the **More > Execute Now** link for the given job on the Scheduled Jobs page. This is useful for some of the scheduled jobs that are designed to be run less frequently, including the geo-coding job and the greetings and addressees job.

### Viewing the job log {:#log}

From the Scheduled Jobs screen, you can click **View Log (all jobs)** or **View Job Log** for a specific scheduled job. Viewing this log is useful for troubleshooting purposes. You can make sure the jobs are running and examine any errors that the jobs output.

!!! note
    The log displays separate entries for the time when a job begins and the time when it finishes. You can examine the time difference between these entries to see how long the job took to complete. Error messages are only displayed in the log entry for the job completion.

### Job.group_cache_flush {:#job_group_cache_flush}

This job purges aged [smart group](../organising-your-data/smart-groups.md) cache data (based on the timeout value). Sites can decide whether they want this job and / or the [group cache rebuild](#job.group_rebuild) job to run. Generally performance is better when old caches are cleared out prior to any attempt to rebuild them (whether on demand or otherwise).

* Name of scheduled job created by default: *(none)*
* Recommended frequency: always
* Parameters: *(none)*

### Job.group_rebuild {:#job_group_rebuild}

Rebuilds the [smart group](../organising-your-data/smart-groups.md) cache. This builds the cache for any smart groups for whom it is empty. If you do not run this it will build groups on demand. Building on demand is more efficient except for 2 operations; viewing the count on manage groups page for all groups and being able to expand the smart groups tab on an individual contact record. If these are important to you then enable this job but expect it to have performance impacts unless you have only a few small smart groups. Note that  you can disable the ability to expand the smart group tab on the contact record and this is recommended for medium sized site (e.g 50k contacts) and larger.

!!! note 
    You can [disable the ability to expand the smart group tab on the contact record](customizing-the-user-interface/#changing-display-preferences) and this is recommended for medium sized site (e.g 50k contacts) and larger.

* Name of scheduled job created by default: Rebuild Smart Group Cache
* Recommended frequency: never
* Parameters: 
    * `limit` (optional): specify a number to limit the number of smart groups that will be rebuilt
